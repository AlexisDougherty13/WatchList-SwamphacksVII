Description: Whether together or remote, watching movies with friends and family is a fun activity. Watch List is a web app for groups or individuals to create and share a movie bucket list.

Run `python flask_app.py` in the root directory to start the server. Then, open  http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in a browser (works best in Edge). Will need the .env file to connect to the database. 

You will need these python packages to run: <br>
`pip install Flask`
`pip install pymongo`
`pip install dotenv`
`pip install Jinja2`
`pip install requests`
`pip install Flask-Cors`
