DevPost: https://devpost.com/software/watch-list

Description: Whether together or remote, watching movies with friends and family is a fun activity. Watch List is a web app for groups or individuals to create and share a movie bucket list.

Run `python flask_app.py` in the root directory to start the server. Will need the .env file to connect to the database. 

You will need these python packages to run:
`pip install Flask`

from pymongo import MongoClient
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os
from jinja2 import escape, Markup
import requests
from flask_cors import CORS
import json
